Wireless Water-pump Automation system controlled by using nrf24l01 Trans-receivers

Wastage of water is a common issue among households. There are industrial grade water level detectors which monitor the water level in tanks and activate or deactivate the motor based on water level.
However, that industrial equipment tends to be expensive for household usage. For this purpose, we have designed an Automatic wireless water pump controller circuit that can monitor water level in your tank and when water reaches maximum threshold of the tank this circuit turns motor off. Similarly, when water level goes below say 10% of total tank capacity, this circuit turns the motor ON enabling water to fill the tank. 
The cycle repeats thereby automating and controlling water flow to the tank.
WireAs we said in introduction manual operation of water pump switch might cause the water wastage due to failure of human consciousness so it needs to be automated instead of manual existence.
